if 10 tests, and alpah is .05, then reject p value of .05/10
if 10 tests, and alpha is .05, then get all p values. Order them. You will have 
i = 1, i=2, i=3...i=10. For i = 1: p <= .05 * 1/10. For i = 2: p <= .05 * 2/10...
so if p_10 = .04, .04 <= .05 * 10/10 no
p_1 = .03; .03 <= .05 * 1/10 = .005
